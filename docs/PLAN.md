## What modl is

The sane, opinionated way to run diffusion locally.

1. **Opinionated model installer** — `modl pull flux-dev`, deps handled, no thinking
2. **Opinionated LoRA trainer** — presets (quick/standard/advanced), sensible defaults
3. **Opinionated generator** — simple flags, seeds, batch, size presets, LoRA stacking

CLI-first. Rust binary + managed Python runtime. Local-first.

## Current Status

**~15K Rust LOC, ~2K Python LOC. 55 unit tests passing. On `main` branch.**

## Phases

### Phase 1 — Bulletproof install + setup ✅

*Done.* One `curl | sh` install. `modl doctor` catches broken symlinks, missing
deps, corrupt files. `modl pull` resolves dependencies. GPU auto-detection picks
the right variant.

Remaining polish:
- [ ] CUDA compatibility edge cases (test on more machines)
- [ ] `modl init` wizard for first-time setup

### Phase 2 — Validate full train→generate flow 🔄

The pipeline exists end-to-end. SDXL LoRA training works with preview generation.

- [x] SDXL LoRA training (confirmed working)
- [x] Training previews / samples
- [x] Dataset annotation
- [x] Style-mode captioning (`--style` strips medium/technique references)
- [ ] Upgrade captioner to Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (instruction-following VLM,
      no regex post-processing needed — tell it "describe content, not style"
      and it obeys. Fits 4090 in float16. Add as `--model qwen` option,
      keep Florence-2 as fast default for non-style captioning)
- [ ] Flux training E2E validation
- [ ] Generation E2E validation (`modl generate` → image on disk)
- [ ] Fix integration issues that surface on GPU

### Phase 3 — Multi-arch training support

Curated ai-toolkit configs for models people actually train on.
See [multi-arch-training-plan.md](multi-arch-training-plan.md) for full gap analysis.

Priority order (by real-world demand):

| # | Model | Status | Effort |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | flux-dev / flux-schnell | ✅ Config ready | — |
| 2 | sdxl / sd1.5 | ✅ Working | — |
| 3 | z-image-turbo | 🟡 Config ready | E2E test |
| 4 | chroma | 🟡 Config ready | E2E test |
| 5 | Flux Kontext | ❌ Needs paired dataset support | ~1h |
| 6 | FLUX.2 | ❌ Needs arch entry | ~30min |
| 7 | Qwen-Image | ❌ Needs qtype + quant for 24GB | ~1h |

### Phase 4 — Polish & batch

- [ ] Batch generation (`modl generate --batch prompts.txt`)
- [ ] Reproducible export (`modl outputs export <id>` → full YAML spec)
- [ ] Registry curation: core tier (flux-dev, flux-schnell, sdxl) vs experimental
- [ ] VRAM-aware config tuning (auto quantize/offload based on GPU)

### Phase 5 — Persistent worker (performance)

Eliminate 20-45s cold start on repeated `modl generate` calls.
Python daemon with LRU model cache, LoRA hot-swap.
See [specs/persistent-worker.md](specs/persistent-worker.md) for full spec.

- [ ] Python serve mode (`modl_worker serve` on Unix socket)
- [ ] Rust worker management (auto-spawn, health check, idle timeout)
- [ ] Model cache with LRU eviction

### Phase 6 — Web UI (`modl serve`)

Prompt-first generate page. Training dashboard. Gallery.
Build only after the CLI flow is rock-solid.
See [archive/ui-architecture.md](archive/ui-architecture.md) for product spec.

This is the foundation of the paid product — same UI powers `modl serve`
(browser, GPU users) and the Tauri native app (Phase 8, Mac/laptop users).
Build with Svelte, compile to a single JS bundle, `include_str!()` into binary.

- [ ] REST + WebSocket API
- [ ] Svelte UI compiled into binary (migrate from vanilla JS)
- [ ] Generate page (prompt → image, LoRA selector)
- [ ] Training dashboard (launch + monitor from UI)
- [ ] Output gallery

### Phase 7 — Cloud training (`--cloud`)

`modl train --cloud` submits to a managed API. **This is the monetization
unlock** — Mac/laptop users with no GPU must use cloud, creating recurring
revenue. Cloud inference deferred (cold start economics are unfavorable).
See [archive/cloud-plan.md](archive/cloud-plan.md) for architecture and pricing model.

- [ ] modl API service (auth, billing, job dispatch)
- [ ] Modal GPU backend
- [ ] CloudExecutor.submit() implementation

### Phase 8 — Native app (Tauri)

Wrap the Phase 6 Svelte UI in a Tauri native app for Mac/Windows distribution.
Same UI, same Rust core, native webview instead of `localhost` in a browser.
Targets the **paying user segment**: creative professionals on laptops with no
GPU who use cloud training (Phase 7).

- [ ] Tauri shell around existing Axum + Svelte stack
- [ ] Native file pickers, drag-and-drop images, dock/taskbar icon
- [ ] Code signing + DMG/MSI distribution
- [ ] Auto-update via Tauri updater

### Backlog — Not planned

| Feature | Why not now |
|---------|------------|
| Video model training (Wan, LTX) | Different pipeline, defer until image is solid |
| CivitAI direct pulls | Need API key setup, lower priority than HF |
| Cloud inference | Cold start + keep_warm economics are brutal |
| DAM / tagging / collections | Filesystem + `modl outputs search` is enough |
| Node/graph editor | ComfyUI owns this, don't compete |
| Multi-provider cloud (RunPod, etc.) | Get one provider working first |

---

## Business model

**CLI is free, open source. Cloud + native app is the paid product.**

Two user segments, different value:

| Segment | What they use | Revenue | Role |
|---------|--------------|---------|------|
| GPU box users (Linux, SSH) | CLI + `modl serve` in browser | Free / low (cloud for heavy models) | Community, testers, contributors |
| Mac/laptop users (no GPU) | Tauri native app + cloud training | Paid (recurring cloud usage) | Paying customers |

The CLI builds credibility and community. Open-source model manager that
"just works" attracts contributors and earns trust. The native app + cloud
backend is where revenue comes from — creative professionals who want
polish and don't have (or want to manage) GPU hardware.

Pricing model TBD — likely per-minute GPU billing with a markup over
raw Modal/RunPod costs, or a subscription with included training minutes.

## What modl is NOT

- Not a node editor (use ComfyUI)
- Not a marketplace (use CivitAI)
- Not infinitely configurable (three presets, Advanced gives full YAML)
- Not a DAM (filesystem + metadata JSON is enough)
- Not an Electron app (Tauri = native webview, Rust backend, no Chromium bloat)
